Computing average surface for 10280 tunnels.
Average surface represented by 323 points.
Computing distance matrix using weighting_coefficient 1.0.
Performing average link hierarchical of 10280 tunnels clustering to create resultsB/data/tree_.txt.
Total java memory: 1118 MB.
Will now allocate additionall memory for the clustering matrix of the size at most 506 MB of RAM...
Maximum allowed cluster-cluster distance matrix size is 15915, in case of memory error in the next computation phase, try to set the parameter murtagh_matrix_size to a lower value in config.txt.
10280 tunnels clustered into 9 clusters using clustering_threshold 7.0.

Leaving only the cheapest tunnel per cluster per snapshot - 2304 tunnels kept.
