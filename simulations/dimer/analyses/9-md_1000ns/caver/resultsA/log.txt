Computing average surface for 10519 tunnels.
Average surface represented by 332 points.
Computing distance matrix using weighting_coefficient 1.0.
Performing average link hierarchical of 10519 tunnels clustering to create resultsA/data/tree_.txt.
Total java memory: 1118 MB.
Will now allocate additionall memory for the clustering matrix of the size at most 511 MB of RAM...
Maximum allowed cluster-cluster distance matrix size is 15987, in case of memory error in the next computation phase, try to set the parameter murtagh_matrix_size to a lower value in config.txt.
10519 tunnels clustered into 12 clusters using clustering_threshold 7.0.

Leaving only the cheapest tunnel per cluster per snapshot - 2485 tunnels kept.
