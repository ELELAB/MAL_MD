Read index groups from /data/user/shared_projects/chalmers/mal/simulations/comparison//index_domains.ndx

Analysis group is 'Protein' (6364 atoms)
Fit group is 'r_177-187_r_209-225_r_235-238_r_251-265_r_270-273_r_281-297_r_303-306_r_313-322_r_327-330_r_338-351_r_355-357_r_365-378_r_382-384' (2009 atoms)
Analysis is mass weighted
Fit is mass weighted
Diagonalized the 19092x19092 covariance matrix
